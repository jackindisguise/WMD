    Problems with access to HelpfileManager in Nanny and unit tests.
    
    Put a small bandaid on it. I'll work on it later.

    Because helpfiles should be human readable and editable, they need linebreaks.
    Unfortunately, JSON doesn't support linebreaks. That leaves me with 2 options:
    1. use a custom plaintext format.
    2. use a markup language of some sort that's easy to include.
    
    I've chosen option 2. I'm using YAML files for helpfiles.
    Also, helpfiles have no significant function other than the data
    they contain, so I didn't create an Helpfile object to manage
    any kind of complex object interactions.

    JSDoc looks in the proper directory.
